## What is this repository about 
This is the repository for the course Open Source Energy System Modeling at Tu Wien, Lecture 2, Homework
The Code is a calculation of the degree of self suffiency of a electricity consumer and a photovoltaics plant. 
The Code calculates the self sufficiency by simply comparing the yield of a pv plant and the consumption and choosing the smaller value which is then set as ownconsumption.
The total amount of ownconsumption is divided by the total amount of power consumption to receive the total degree of self sufficiency.
